    "**Pip** is a package manager for python. You may see people using pip with environments using [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) or [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).\n",

    "\n",
    "It is good coding practice to use virtual environments with Python. From [this blog](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/a-complete-guide-to-python-virtual-environments/):\n",
    "\n",
    "> A Python virtual environment consists of two essential components: the Python interpreter that the virtual environment runs on and a folder containing third-party libraries installed in the virtual environment. These virtual environments are isolated from the other virtual environments, which means any changes on dependencies installed in a virtual environment don’t affect the dependencies of the other virtual environments or the system-wide libraries. Thus, we can create multiple virtual environments with different Python versions, plus different libraries or the same libraries in different versions.\n",

    "We recommend creating a virtual environment for your STAT-486 coding projects. This way, you can have an environment with all the necessary packages and you can easily keep track of what versions of the packages you used.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open Terminal (macOS) or a shell \n",
    "2. Create an environment called `stat486` using Conda with the command:\n",
    "   ```conda create --name stat486```\n",
    "3. To install packages in your environment, first activate your environment:\n",
    "   ```conda activate stat486```\n",
    "4. Then, install the following packages using the command:\n",
    "   ```conda install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter ipykernel```\n",
    "5. Install PyTorch by running the appropriate command from [here](https://pytorch.org) (for macOS, the command is: `pip3 install torch torchvision`)\n",
    "6. To exit your environment:\n",
    "   ```conda deactivate```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a helpful [cheatsheet](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) for `conda` environment commands.\n",
